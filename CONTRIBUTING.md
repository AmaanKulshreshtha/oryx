## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. How to Start the project
    - To kickstart oryx
    ```bash
    cd packages/oryx
    yarn install # install node_modules
    yarn start # run webpack in watch mode
    ```

    - Open a new terminal
    - To kickstart the example

    ```bash
    cd packages/examples
    yarn install # install node_modules
    yarn start # build with webpack and serve using webpack dev server
    ```
3. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
4. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
5. Ensure the test suite passes.
6. Make sure your code lints.
7. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/briandk/transcriptase-atom/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a bug report, and I think it's not a bad model.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

<!-- ## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* You can try running `npm run lint` for style unification -->
